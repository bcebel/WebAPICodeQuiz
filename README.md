The game starts by pressing start!  Then a countdown will start, if you get an incorrect answer 5 seconds are removed from your time.  Upon completion of the quiz you are prompted to enter your initials to recieve your score.  A leader board appears with the previous top 3 scores, if you make the top three you will be on the list for the next round.  

Challenges were navigating objects and DOM manipulation!  HOWEVER!  Now that I see the relationship between objects and methods and the galaxy of JavaScript I can see the possibilities are endless!
